Overview

This project is a classic Snake Game developed using C++ and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The aim of the game is to control the snake using arrow keys, eat the food that appears randomly on the screen, and grow in length while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snakeâ€™s own body.

The game delivers an engaging experience with:

Smooth graphics

Reactive controls

Sound effects for game events

Increasing difficulty levels based on performance

It serves as a complete, beginner-friendly introduction to 2D game development in C++, integrating graphics, real-time input handling, and audio.

âš™ Features

Graphical Interface: A visually polished grid-based layout using SFMLâ€™s graphics module.

Audio Effects: Real-time sound feedback with eat and game over effects.

Responsive Controls: Arrow keys control the snake in all four directions.

Score Display: A live score counter is updated as the snake eats food.

Game Over State: Collision with walls or self triggers a clear "Game Over" screen.

Restart Mechanism: Pressing R restarts the game instantly without relaunching the program.

Increasing Difficulty: The speed of the snake increases gradually as you score higher, creating a natural difficulty curve.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

Language: C++

Library: SFML 2.5+ (Graphics, Window, System, Audio)

Assets:

eat.wav â€“ Sound played when food is eaten

gameover.wav â€“ Sound played upon losing

sansation.ttf â€“ Font used for displaying text

Game Mechanics

Movement: The snake moves continuously. Use arrow keys to change direction.

Food: Randomly spawned red circles. Eating one increases the snakeâ€™s length and score.

Score: Each food is worth 10 points. Displayed in real-time.

Game Over: Occurs when the snake runs into the wall or itself.

Restart: Press R after a game over to start a new game.

ðŸ“Œ Educational Value

This project is ideal for learners looking to:

Understand real-time input handling in C++

Implement classic game mechanics

Use SFML for window creation, drawing, and audio

Apply modular object-oriented design

ðŸ§  Future Enhancements

High score tracking

Level design and obstacles

Background music

Pause/resume functionality

Game settings menu
